## Lesson 1: Getting Started - Introduction to Python and Setting up the Environment

This lesson introduces you to the Python programming language and guides you through setting up your development environment.

**Topics Covered:**

* What is Python?
* Installing Python
* Setting up an IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
* Running your first Python program


### 1. What is Python?

**Definition:** Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its readability and versatility. It emphasizes code clarity and uses indentation to define code blocks, making it easier to learn and use compared to some other languages.

**Key Features:**

* **Interpreted:** Python code is executed line by line, making debugging easier.
* **Dynamically Typed:** You don't need to explicitly declare variable types. Python infers them automatically.
* **Object-Oriented:** Python supports object-oriented programming principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
* **Large Standard Library:** Python comes with a vast collection of pre-built modules and functions, providing ready-made solutions for various tasks.
* **Extensive Third-Party Libraries:**  A rich ecosystem of external libraries extends Python's capabilities for specialized tasks like web development, data science, machine learning, and more.


### 2. Installing Python

**Instructions:**

1. **Download:** Visit the official Python website (python.org) and download the latest stable version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
2. **Installation:** Run the downloaded installer.  Make sure to check the box that adds Python to your system's PATH environment variable. This allows you to run Python from your command line or terminal.
3. **Verification:** Open your command line/terminal and type `python --version` or `python3 --version` (depending on your installation).  If Python is installed correctly, it will display the version number.


### 3. Setting up an IDE (Integrated Development Environment)

**Definition:** An IDE is a software application that provides comprehensive tools for software development. It typically includes a code editor, debugger, and other helpful features.

**Recommended IDEs for Python:**

* **VS Code (Visual Studio Code):** Free, open-source, highly customizable, and excellent Python support with extensions.
* **PyCharm:** Powerful IDE specifically designed for Python development.  Offers a free Community edition and a paid Professional edition.
* **Thonny:** A beginner-friendly IDE that's simple to use and comes with Python built-in.

**Setting up VS Code (Example):**

1. **Download and Install:** Download VS Code from the official website (code.visualstudio.com).
2. **Install Python Extension:** Open VS Code, go to the Extensions Marketplace (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X), search for "Python", and install the official Python extension by Microsoft.


### 4. Running your first Python program

**Steps:**

1. **Create a Python file:** Open your IDE or a text editor and create a new file named `hello.py`.
2. **Write the code:**  Enter the following code into the file:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

3. **Run the code:**
    * **From the IDE:**  Most IDEs have a "Run" button or menu option. Click it to execute your code.
    * **From the command line/terminal:** Navigate to the directory where you saved `hello.py` and type `python hello.py` or `python3 hello.py`.


### Exercises

1. **Installation Check:** Verify your Python installation by running the `python --version` command in your terminal/command line. What version did you install?
2. **Print your name:** Modify the `hello.py` program to print your name instead of "Hello, World!".
3. **Simple Calculation:** Write a Python program that calculates the sum of two numbers (e.g., 5 and 3) and prints the result.
4. **Explore the IDE:**  If you're using VS Code or PyCharm, explore the different features of the IDE. Try using the debugger to step through your code line by line.
5. **Install a library:** Install the `requests` library (used for making HTTP requests) using pip: `pip install requests` or `pip3 install requests`.  Verify the installation by running `pip show requests` or `pip3 show requests`.


This lesson provides a foundation for your Python journey.  Practice the exercises and explore the resources mentioned to solidify your understanding.  In the next lesson, we'll delve into Python's data types and variables.

## Lesson 2: Data Types and Operators

This lesson covers the fundamental building blocks of programming: data types and operators.  Understanding these concepts is crucial for writing effective and efficient code.

### 1. Variables

A **variable** is a named storage location in a computer's memory.  It holds a value that can be accessed and manipulated throughout your program.  Think of it like a labeled container.

**Example:**

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 30
```

Here, `name` and `age` are variables storing the values "Alice" and 30, respectively.

### 2. Data Types

Data types classify the kind of value a variable can hold.  Python has several built-in data types:

* **int (Integer):** Represents whole numbers (e.g., 10, -5, 0).
* **float (Floating-point):** Represents numbers with decimal points (e.g., 3.14, -2.5, 0.0).
* **string (String):** Represents a sequence of characters enclosed in single or double quotes (e.g., "Hello", 'Python').
* **bool (Boolean):** Represents truth values, either `True` or `False`.

**Examples:**

```python
integer_variable = 10
float_variable = 2.718
string_variable = "Hello, world!"
boolean_variable = True
```

### 3. Arithmetic Operators

These operators perform mathematical calculations:

* `+` (Addition)
* `-` (Subtraction)
* `*` (Multiplication)
* `/` (Division)
* `//` (Floor Division - returns the integer part of the division)
* `%` (Modulo - returns the remainder of the division)
* `**` (Exponentiation)

**Examples:**

```python
result = 10 + 5  # 15
result = 10 - 5  # 5
result = 10 * 5  # 50
result = 10 / 5  # 2.0
result = 10 // 3 # 3
result = 10 % 3  # 1
result = 2 ** 3  # 8
```

### 4. Comparison Operators

These operators compare two values and return a boolean result:

* `==` (Equal to)
* `!=` (Not equal to)
* `>` (Greater than)
* `<` (Less than)
* `>=` (Greater than or equal to)
* `<=` (Less than or equal to)

**Examples:**

```python
is_equal = 10 == 5  # False
is_not_equal = 10 != 5  # True
is_greater = 10 > 5  # True
```

### 5. Logical Operators

These operators combine or modify boolean expressions:

* `and` (True if both operands are True)
* `or` (True if at least one operand is True)
* `not` (Inverts the boolean value)

**Examples:**

```python
result = True and False  # False
result = True or False  # True
result = not True  # False
```

### 6. Type Conversion

Sometimes, you need to convert a value from one data type to another.  This is called type conversion or typecasting.

**Examples:**

```python
string_number = "10"
integer_number = int(string_number)  # Converts the string "10" to the integer 10
float_number = float(integer_number) # Converts the integer 10 to the float 10.0
string_float = str(float_number) # Converts the float 10.0 to the string "10.0"
```


### Exercises

1. **Variable Assignment:** Create variables to store your name, age, and favorite color. Print these variables.

2. **Arithmetic Operations:** Write a program that calculates the area of a rectangle given its length and width (stored as variables).

3. **Comparison and Logical Operators:** Write a program that checks if a number (stored in a variable) is even and greater than 10. Print the result.

4. **Type Conversion:**  Take user input for their age (as a string). Convert it to an integer and add 5 to it. Print the result.

5. **Challenge:** Write a program that takes two numbers as input from the user, converts them to floats, and then performs all the arithmetic operations on them. Print the results of each operation.


These exercises will help you solidify your understanding of data types and operators in Python.  Experiment and try different variations to further explore these concepts. Remember to use the `print()` function to display the results of your code.

## Lesson 3: Control Flow - Controlling Program Flow with Conditional Statements

This lesson explores how to control the execution path of your Python programs using conditional statements.  This allows your programs to make decisions and execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Conditional Statements:** These statements allow you to execute a block of code only if a specific condition is met. Python uses `if`, `elif` (short for "else if"), and `else` to create conditional statements.
* **Nested Conditions:**  Placing conditional statements inside other conditional statements allows for more complex decision-making logic.
* **Boolean Logic:**  This system uses boolean values (`True` or `False`) and operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) to evaluate conditions.

**1. Conditional Statements (if, elif, else):**

The basic structure of a conditional statement is:

```python
if condition:
    # Code to execute if the condition is True
elif another_condition:
    # Code to execute if the first condition is False and this condition is True
else:
    # Code to execute if none of the above conditions are True
```

**Example:**

```python
temperature = 25

if temperature > 30:
    print("It's a hot day!")
elif temperature > 20:
    print("It's a pleasant day.")
else:
    print("It's a bit cool.")
```

**2. Nested Conditions:**

You can nest conditional statements within each other to create more complex logic.

**Example:**

```python
age = 25
has_license = True

if age >= 18:
    if has_license:
        print("You can drive.")
    else:
        print("You are old enough, but you need a driver's license.")
else:
    print("You are too young to drive.")
```

**3. Boolean Logic:**

Boolean logic helps combine and modify conditions.

* **`and`:** Returns `True` if both operands are `True`.
* **`or`:** Returns `True` if at least one operand is `True`.
* **`not`:** Inverts the boolean value of the operand.

**Example:**

```python
is_raining = True
has_umbrella = False

if is_raining and not has_umbrella:
    print("Take an umbrella!")
elif is_raining and has_umbrella:
    print("Good, you have an umbrella!")
else:
    print("Enjoy the weather!")
```


**Exercises:**

**Exercise 1: Grade Calculator:**

Write a program that takes a student's score (0-100) as input and prints their grade based on the following criteria:

* 90-100: A
* 80-89: B
* 70-79: C
* 60-69: D
* Below 60: F

**Exercise 2: Leap Year Checker:**

Write a program that takes a year as input and determines if it's a leap year. A leap year is divisible by 4, except for years divisible by 100 but not by 400.

**Exercise 3:  Even or Odd and Positive or Negative:**

Write a program that takes an integer as input and prints whether it's even or odd and whether it's positive, negative, or zero.  Use nested `if` statements and boolean logic.


**Exercise 4:  Rock, Paper, Scissors:**

Create a simplified Rock, Paper, Scissors game.  Prompt the user for their choice (rock, paper, or scissors) and have the computer randomly choose.  Print the winner based on the following rules:

* Rock beats Scissors
* Scissors beats Paper
* Paper beats Rock

**(Hint:  Use the `random` module to generate the computer's choice.)**

## Lesson 4: Loops - Working with Repetitive Tasks

Loops are fundamental programming constructs that allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly.  They are essential for automating tasks and handling collections of data. This lesson covers `for` loops, `while` loops, and loop control statements (`break`, `continue`).

### I. For Loops

**Definition:** A `for` loop iterates over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range) or other iterable object, executing a block of code for each item in the sequence.

**Syntax:**

```python
for item in sequence:
    # Code to be executed for each item
```

**Examples:**

```python
# Iterating over a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

# Iterating over a string
message = "hello"
for char in message:
    print(char)

# Iterating over a range
for i in range(5):  # Range(5) generates numbers from 0 to 4
    print(i)

# Iterating with index using enumerate
for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
    print(f"Fruit at index {index}: {fruit}")
```

### II. While Loops

**Definition:** A `while` loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a given condition is true.

**Syntax:**

```python
while condition:
    # Code to be executed while the condition is true
```

**Examples:**

```python
# Counting from 1 to 5
count = 1
while count <= 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1

# User input loop
user_input = ""
while user_input != "quit":
    user_input = input("Enter a command (or 'quit' to exit): ")
    print(f"You entered: {user_input}")
```

### III. Loop Control Statements

Loop control statements allow you to modify the normal flow of a loop.

**A. `break` Statement:**

**Definition:** The `break` statement terminates the loop prematurely, even if the loop condition is still true.

**Example:**

```python
for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        break  # Exit the loop when i is 5
    print(i)
```

**B. `continue` Statement:**

**Definition:** The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration and proceeds to the next iteration of the loop.

**Example:**

```python
for i in range(10):
    if i % 2 == 0:  # Skip even numbers
        continue
    print(i)  # Prints only odd numbers
```


### IV. Exercises

1. **Print even numbers:** Write a program that uses a `for` loop and the `range` function to print all even numbers between 1 and 20.

2. **Calculate factorial:** Write a program that uses a `while` loop to calculate the factorial of a given number.  (Factorial of n is the product of all positive integers up to n.  Example: 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120)

3. **Find the first negative number:** Write a program that takes a list of numbers as input and uses a `for` loop and the `break` statement to find and print the first negative number in the list. If there are no negative numbers, print "No negative numbers found."

4. **Print numbers except multiples of 5:** Write a program that uses a `for` loop and the `continue` statement to print all numbers between 1 and 50, except for multiples of 5.

5. **Sum of digits:** Write a program that takes an integer as input and uses a `while` loop to calculate the sum of its digits. (Hint: Use the modulo operator `%` and integer division `//` to extract digits.)

**Exercise 1:**

```python
for i in range(2, 21, 2):
    print(i)
```

**Exercise 2:**

```python
n = int(input("Enter a number: "))
factorial = 1
i = 1
while i <= n:
    factorial *= i
    i += 1
print(f"The factorial of {n} is {factorial}")
```

**Exercise 3:**

```python
numbers = [1, 5, -2, 3, 7, -4]
found_negative = False
for number in numbers:
    if number < 0:
        print(f"First negative number: {number}")
        found_negative = True
        break
if not found_negative:
    print("No negative numbers found.")

```

**Exercise 4:**

```python
for i in range(1, 51):
    if i % 5 == 0:
        continue
    print(i)
```

**Exercise 5:**

```python
num = int(input("Enter an integer: "))
sum_of_digits = 0
while num > 0:
    digit = num % 10
    sum_of_digits += digit
    num //= 10
print(f"The sum of digits is: {sum_of_digits}")
```

## Lesson 5: Functions - Organizing Code into Reusable Blocks

Functions are fundamental building blocks in programming. They allow you to encapsulate a block of code, give it a name, and reuse it multiple times throughout your program. This promotes code organization, readability, and maintainability.

### Defining Functions

A function is defined using the `def` keyword followed by the function name, parentheses `()`, and a colon `:`. The code block within the function is indented.

**Syntax:**

```python
def function_name(arguments):
    """Docstring explaining the function."""
    # Code block
    # ...
    return value  # Optional return statement
```

**Critical Concepts:**

* **Function Name:** A descriptive name that reflects the function's purpose.
* **Arguments (Parameters):**  Input values passed to the function.  They are optional.
* **Docstring:** A string enclosed in triple quotes (`"""Docstring"""`) that explains what the function does. It's good practice to always include a docstring.
* **Code Block:** The set of instructions executed when the function is called.
* **Return Statement:**  Specifies the value returned by the function.  It's optional. If omitted, the function returns `None`.

**Example:**

```python
def greet(name):
    """Greets the person passed in as a parameter."""
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("Alice")  # Output: Hello, Alice!
```

### Function Arguments

Arguments allow you to pass data into a function.  

**Types of Arguments:**

* **Positional Arguments:**  Passed in the order they are defined in the function.
* **Keyword Arguments:** Passed with the argument name, allowing for flexibility in order.
* **Default Arguments:**  Provide a default value if the argument is not passed.

**Example:**

```python
def describe_pet(animal_type, pet_name="Buddy"):
    """Displays information about a pet."""
    print(f"I have a {animal_type}.")
    print(f"My {animal_type}'s name is {pet_name}.")

describe_pet("hamster", "Harry")  # Positional arguments
describe_pet(animal_type="dog", pet_name="Rover") # Keyword arguments
describe_pet("cat") # Uses the default argument for pet_name
```

### Return Values

The `return` statement sends a value back to the caller of the function.

**Example:**

```python
def add(x, y):
    """Adds two numbers and returns the sum."""
    return x + y

result = add(5, 3)
print(result)  # Output: 8
```

### Scope and Lifetime of Variables

* **Scope:** The region of the code where a variable is accessible.
* **Lifetime:** The duration for which a variable exists in memory.

Variables defined inside a function have **local scope**, meaning they are only accessible within that function.  Their lifetime is limited to the function's execution. Variables defined outside any function have **global scope**.

**Example:**

```python
global_var = 10

def my_function():
    local_var = 5
    print(global_var)  # Accessing a global variable
    print(local_var)

my_function() # Output: 10, 5
# print(local_var)  # This would cause an error because local_var is not accessible outside the function
```


### Exercises

1. **Write a function called `subtract` that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their difference.**

2. **Write a function called `calculate_area` that calculates the area of a rectangle. It should take `length` and `width` as arguments and return the area.**

3. **Write a function called `is_even` that takes a number as an argument and returns `True` if the number is even, and `False` otherwise.**

4. **What is the output of the following code? Explain why.**

```python
x = 10

def modify_x():
    x = 5
    print(x)

modify_x()
print(x)
```

5. **Write a function called `greet_with_default` that takes a name as an argument and greets the person.  If no name is provided, it should greet "World".**


### Solutions to Exercises (Hidden - Expand to reveal)

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal solutions</summary>

1.
```python
def subtract(x, y):
    return x - y
```

2.
```python
def calculate_area(length, width):
    return length * width
```

3.
```python
def is_even(number):
    return number % 2 == 0
```

4. The output is:
```
5
10
```
The `x` inside `modify_x` is a local variable, different from the global `x`.  Modifying the local `x` doesn't affect the global `x`.

5.
```python
def greet_with_default(name="World"):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

## Lesson 6: Data Structures - Storing and Manipulating Collections of Data

This lesson covers fundamental data structures in Python, focusing on how to store and manipulate collections of data efficiently. We'll explore Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries, along with the powerful concept of List Comprehensions.

**Critical Concepts:**

* **Lists:** Ordered, mutable (changeable) sequences of items.  They can contain elements of different data types.
* **Tuples:** Ordered, immutable (unchangeable) sequences of items.  Like lists, they can contain elements of different data types.
* **Sets:** Unordered collections of unique items.  Useful for membership testing and eliminating duplicates.
* **Dictionaries:** Unordered collections of key-value pairs.  Keys must be immutable (e.g., strings, numbers, tuples), while values can be any data type.
* **List Comprehensions:** A concise way to create lists based on existing iterables.


**Samples of Concepts:**

```python
# Lists
my_list = [1, "hello", 3.14, True]
my_list.append(5)  # Add an element
my_list[0] = 2  # Modify an element

# Tuples
my_tuple = (1, "hello", 3.14, True)
# my_tuple[0] = 2  # This will raise an error because tuples are immutable

# Sets
my_set = {1, 2, 2, 3}  # Duplicates are removed
print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3}
my_set.add(4)

# Dictionaries
my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
print(my_dict["name"])  # Output: Alice
my_dict["age"] = 31  # Modify a value

# List Comprehensions
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]  # Creates a list of squares from 0 to 81
even_squares = [x**2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0] # Creates a list of even squares from 0 to 64
```


**Exercises:**

**Exercise 1: List Manipulation**

1. Create a list of your favorite fruits.
2. Add a new fruit to the end of the list.
3. Replace the second fruit in the list with another fruit.
4. Print the updated list.

**Exercise 2: Tuple Operations**

1. Create a tuple containing your name, age, and favorite color.
2. Try to modify one of the elements in the tuple. Explain what happens.
3. Access and print the second element of the tuple.

**Exercise 3: Set Operations**

1. Create two sets: one containing even numbers from 1 to 10 and another containing prime numbers from 1 to 10.
2. Find the union of the two sets.
3. Find the intersection of the two sets.
4. Print the results.

**Exercise 4: Dictionary Operations**

1. Create a dictionary representing a student's information (name, age, grades).  Grades should be stored as a list.
2. Add a new key-value pair to the dictionary representing the student's major.
3. Access and print the student's age.
4. Access and print the student's grades in math. (Assume math is the first grade in the list)


**Exercise 5: List Comprehensions**

1. Use a list comprehension to create a list of the cubes of the numbers from 1 to 20.
2. Use a list comprehension to create a list of all even numbers between 1 and 50 that are divisible by 3.


**Solutions (Partial - encourages independent problem-solving):**

**Exercise 2.2:** You'll encounter a `TypeError` because tuples are immutable.

**Exercise 3:**

```python
even_numbers = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}
prime_numbers = {2, 3, 5, 7}

union_set = even_numbers.union(prime_numbers)
intersection_set = even_numbers.intersection(prime_numbers)

print(union_set)
print(intersection_set)
```


This lesson provides a foundation for understanding and using data structures in Python.  Mastering these concepts is crucial for writing efficient and organized code. Remember to practice and experiment with different operations to solidify your understanding.

## Lesson 7: File Handling - Reading and Writing Data to Files

This lesson covers the fundamentals of file handling in programming, focusing on reading and writing data to files.  We'll explore how to open and close files, read data from them, write data to them, and handle different file formats.

**Critical Concepts:**

* **File:** A named location on a storage medium (like a hard drive or SSD) used to permanently store data.  Files can contain various types of data, including text, images, code, and more.
* **File Path:** The complete location address of a file on the system. This can be an absolute path (starting from the root directory) or a relative path (relative to the current working directory).  Example: `/home/user/documents/myfile.txt` (absolute) or `./data/myfile.txt` (relative).
* **File Object:** A representation of a file within a program.  It acts as an intermediary, allowing you to interact with the file's contents without directly manipulating the file on the disk.
* **File Modes:**  Specify how a file will be accessed (read, write, append, etc.). Common modes include:
    * `"r"`: Read mode (default). Opens the file for reading.  Raises an error if the file doesn't exist.
    * `"w"`: Write mode. Opens the file for writing. Creates the file if it doesn't exist; overwrites the file if it does.
    * `"a"`: Append mode. Opens the file for writing. Creates the file if it doesn't exist; appends data to the end of the file if it does.
    * `"x"`: Exclusive creation mode. Creates and opens the file for writing only if it doesn't already exist.
    * `"b"`: Binary mode. Used for non-text files (e.g., images, audio).  Often combined with other modes (e.g., `"rb"`, `"wb"`).
    * `"t"`: Text mode (default). Used for text files.
* **File Pointer:** An internal marker that indicates the current position within a file.  Reading or writing operations start from the file pointer's location.


**Samples of Concepts (Python):**

```python
# Opening a file for reading
file_object = open("my_file.txt", "r")

# Reading the entire file content
content = file_object.read()
print(content)

# Reading line by line
file_object.seek(0) # Reset file pointer to the beginning
for line in file_object:
    print(line, end="")

# Writing to a file
with open("output.txt", "w") as file_object:
    file_object.write("This is some text.\n")
    file_object.write("This is another line.")

# Appending to a file
with open("output.txt", "a") as file_object:
    file_object.write("\nThis is appended text.")

# Closing a file (important to release resources)
file_object.close()


# Working with different file formats (CSV example)
import csv

with open("data.csv", "r") as file_object:
    reader = csv.reader(file_object)
    for row in reader:
        print(row)

with open("output.csv", "w", newline="") as file_object:
    writer = csv.writer(file_object)
    writer.writerow(["Name", "Age", "City"])
    writer.writerow(["John Doe", 30, "New York"])

```


**Exercises:**

1. **File Reading:** Write a program that reads a text file and prints the number of lines, words, and characters in the file.

2. **File Writing:** Create a program that takes user input (name, age, city) and writes it to a CSV file.

3. **File Manipulation:** Write a program that reads a text file, replaces all occurrences of a specific word with another word, and writes the modified text to a new file.

4. **Error Handling:** Modify the file reading program from Exercise 1 to handle the case where the file doesn't exist (using `try-except` blocks).

5. **JSON Handling:** Explore the `json` module in Python. Write a program that reads data from a JSON file, modifies it, and writes the updated data back to the JSON file.  (Example JSON: `{"name": "John", "age": 30}`)


These exercises will help you practice the concepts of file handling and solidify your understanding of working with files in your programs. Remember to always close files after you're done with them to prevent resource leaks and potential data corruption.  Good luck!

## Lesson 8: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) - Introduction

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code around "objects" which contain both data (attributes) and actions that can be performed on that data (methods). This approach helps to create modular, reusable, and maintainable code.

**Key Concepts:**

1. **Classes and Objects:**

   * **Class:** A blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the attributes and methods that objects of that class will have. Think of it like a cookie cutter.
   * **Object:** An instance of a class. It's the actual cookie created using the cookie cutter. Each object has its own set of attribute values.

   **Example:**

   ```python
   class Dog:  # Class definition
       def __init__(self, name, breed):
           self.name = name  # Attribute
           self.breed = breed # Attribute

       def bark(self):  # Method
           print("Woof!")

   my_dog = Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever") # Object instantiation
   print(my_dog.name)  # Accessing attribute
   my_dog.bark()      # Calling method

   another_dog = Dog("Lucy", "Labrador") # Another object, different attributes
   ```

2. **Attributes and Methods:**

   * **Attributes:** Variables that hold data associated with an object. They describe the characteristics of an object.  In the example above, `name` and `breed` are attributes.
   * **Methods:** Functions that are associated with an object and define its behavior. They operate on the object's attributes. `bark()` is a method.

3. **Inheritance:**

   * A mechanism that allows a class (child class or subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent class or superclass). This promotes code reuse and establishes "is-a" relationships.

   **Example:**

   ```python
   class Animal:
       def __init__(self, name):
           self.name = name

       def speak(self):
           print("Generic animal sound")

   class Dog(Animal): # Dog inherits from Animal
       def speak(self): # Overriding the speak method
           print("Woof!")

   my_dog = Dog("Buddy")
   my_dog.speak() # Output: Woof!

   my_animal = Animal("Generic")
   my_animal.speak() # Output: Generic animal sound
   ```

4. **Polymorphism:**

   * The ability of objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in their own specific way.  This is often achieved through method overriding (as seen in the inheritance example above).  Polymorphism enables flexibility and extensibility in code.


**Exercises:**

1. **Create a `Car` class:**
    * Attributes: `make`, `model`, `year`, `color`
    * Methods: `start()`, `stop()`, `honk()`

2. **Create a `BankAccount` class:**
    * Attributes: `account_number`, `balance`
    * Methods: `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, `check_balance()`

3. **Extend the `Animal` class example:**
    * Create a `Cat` class that inherits from `Animal`.
    * Override the `speak()` method to print "Meow!".
    * Create instances of both `Dog` and `Cat` and call their `speak()` methods.

4. **Challenge:** Create a `Shape` class with a method `calculate_area()`.  Create subclasses like `Circle`, `Rectangle`, and `Triangle` that inherit from `Shape` and implement their own `calculate_area()` methods.  This demonstrates polymorphism.


**Further Exploration:**

* **Encapsulation:** Bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data within a class, and controlling access to them.  This is often achieved using access modifiers (public, private, protected – Python uses conventions like underscores for protected/private).
* **Abstraction:** Hiding complex implementation details and showing only essential information to the user.  Abstract classes and interfaces are tools for achieving abstraction.


This lesson provides a foundational understanding of OOP principles.  As you progress, you'll explore these concepts in greater depth and learn how to apply them effectively in your programs.

## Lesson 9: Modules and Packages - Working with External Libraries and Modules

This lesson explores how to extend Python's functionality by leveraging external code through modules and packages. We'll cover importing modules, using standard library modules, installing and using third-party libraries, and creating your own modules.

**Critical Concepts:**

* **Module:** A single Python file containing functions, classes, and variables that can be reused in other Python programs.  Think of it as a toolbox filled with specific tools (functions, classes).
* **Package:** A collection of related modules organized in a directory hierarchy.  It's like a workshop containing multiple toolboxes (modules) for a specific area of work.
* **Standard Library:** A collection of pre-built modules included with Python that provide a wide range of functionalities, from file I/O to web servers.  It's the basic set of tools Python comes with.
* **Third-Party Library:**  Modules or packages created by the Python community and available for download and installation, extending Python's capabilities even further. These are specialized tools built by others that you can add to your workshop.
* **`import` statement:** The keyword used to bring external code (modules/packages) into your current Python script.  It's how you access the tools in the toolboxes.


**Samples of Concepts:**

* **Module Example:** `math` (provides mathematical functions), `os` (interacts with the operating system)
* **Package Example:** `requests` (for making HTTP requests), `NumPy` (for numerical computing)
* **Standard Library Example:** Using `os.path.exists()` to check if a file exists.
* **Third-Party Library Example:** Using `requests.get()` to fetch data from a website.
* **`import` statement Examples:**
    * `import math` (imports the entire `math` module)
    * `from math import sqrt` (imports only the `sqrt` function from the `math` module)
    * `import numpy as np` (imports `numpy` and gives it the alias `np`)


**Exercises:**

**Exercise 1: Working with the `math` module (Standard Library)**

1. Import the `math` module.
2. Calculate the square root of 25 using `math.sqrt()`.
3. Calculate the cosine of 0 using `math.cos()`.
4. Round the value of pi (`math.pi`) to 2 decimal places using `round()`.

```python
import math

# Calculate square root of 25
sqrt_25 = math.sqrt(25)
print(f"Square root of 25: {sqrt_25}")

# Calculate cosine of 0
cos_0 = math.cos(0)
print(f"Cosine of 0: {cos_0}")

# Round pi to 2 decimal places
rounded_pi = round(math.pi, 2)
print(f"Pi rounded to 2 decimal places: {rounded_pi}")
```

**Exercise 2: Using the `os` module (Standard Library)**

1. Import the `os` module.
2. Print the current working directory using `os.getcwd()`.
3. Create a new directory named "my_directory" using `os.makedirs()` (handle potential errors if the directory already exists).
4. Check if "my_directory" exists using `os.path.exists()`.

```python
import os

# Print current working directory
print(f"Current directory: {os.getcwd()}")

# Create a new directory
try:
    os.makedirs("my_directory")
    print("Directory 'my_directory' created successfully.")
except FileExistsError:
    print("Directory 'my_directory' already exists.")

# Check if directory exists
if os.path.exists("my_directory"):
    print("Directory 'my_directory' exists.")
else:
    print("Directory 'my_directory' does not exist.")

```

**Exercise 3: Installing and using a third-party library (`requests`)**

1. Install the `requests` library using pip: `pip install requests` (do this in your terminal or command prompt, not in the Python script).
2. Import the `requests` library.
3. Make a GET request to `https://www.example.com/`.
4. Print the status code of the response.
5. Print the content of the response.

```python
import requests

# Make a GET request
response = requests.get("https://www.example.com/")

# Print status code
print(f"Status code: {response.status_code}")

# Print content
print(response.text)

```

**Exercise 4: Creating your own module**

1. Create a new Python file named `my_module.py`.
2. Define a function called `greet(name)` inside `my_module.py` that prints "Hello, [name]!".
3. In a separate Python file, import `my_module`.
4. Call the `greet()` function from your module, passing your name as an argument.

**my_module.py:**

```python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

**main.py:**

```python
import my_module

my_module.greet("Your Name")
```


These exercises cover the core concepts of working with modules and packages in Python.  By completing them, you'll gain practical experience in extending Python's capabilities and organizing your code effectively. Remember to consult the official Python documentation for more in-depth information on specific modules and libraries.

## Lesson 10: Exception Handling - Handling Errors and Exceptions

This lesson covers how to gracefully handle errors and exceptions in your Python code using `try-except` blocks, raising exceptions, and handling different exception types.

**Critical Concepts:**

* **Exception:** An event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions.  Exceptions can be caused by various factors, such as invalid input, file not found errors, network issues, or programming errors.
* **`try-except` Block:** A control flow structure used to handle exceptions.  The `try` block contains the code that might raise an exception. The `except` block contains the code that is executed if an exception of a specific type occurs within the `try` block.
* **Raising Exceptions:**  Intentionally generating an exception using the `raise` keyword. This is useful for signaling errors or exceptional conditions in your code.
* **Exception Types:**  Different kinds of exceptions represent different error conditions.  Examples include `TypeError`, `ValueError`, `FileNotFoundError`, `ZeroDivisionError`, and many more.  Knowing the specific exception type allows you to handle different errors appropriately.
* **`finally` Block (Optional):** A block of code that is always executed, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.  Useful for cleanup tasks like closing files or releasing resources.


**Samples of Concepts:**

```python
# try-except block
try:
    result = 10 / 0  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error: Division by zero")

# Raising an exception
def validate_age(age):
    if age < 0:
        raise ValueError("Age cannot be negative")

# Handling different exception types
try:
    file = open("nonexistent_file.txt", "r")
    num = int("abc")  # This will raise a ValueError
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Error: File not found")
except ValueError:
    print("Error: Invalid input")

# finally block
try:
    f = open("myfile.txt", "w")
    f.write("Some text")
except Exception as e:  # Catches any exception
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
finally:
    f.close()  # Ensures the file is closed even if an error occurs
```


**Exercises:**

1. **File Handling with Exception Handling:** Write a program that asks the user for a filename.  Try to open the file in read mode.  Handle the `FileNotFoundError` if the file doesn't exist, printing an appropriate message to the user.

2. **Integer Input Validation:** Write a function that takes user input and converts it to an integer.  Use a `try-except` block to handle the `ValueError` that might occur if the user enters non-numeric input.  Prompt the user again if the input is invalid.

3. **Custom Exception:** Create a custom exception class called `InvalidEmailError`.  Write a function that checks if an email address contains the "@" symbol.  Raise an `InvalidEmailError` if the email is invalid.  Handle this custom exception in your main program.

4. **Calculator with Error Handling:**  Create a simple calculator program that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  Use `try-except` blocks to handle potential errors like `ZeroDivisionError` and `ValueError` (if the user enters non-numeric input).

5. **Database Connection with `finally`:**  (Advanced) Simulate a database connection using a `try-except-finally` block.  In the `try` block, "open" the connection (print "Connection opened").  Simulate a query (print "Query executed").  In the `except` block (for a generic `Exception`), print "An error occurred during database operation".  In the `finally` block, "close" the connection (print "Connection closed").  Observe how the `finally` block always executes, ensuring the connection is "closed" even if an error occurs.



**Solutions (Partial - to encourage independent problem-solving):**

```python
# Exercise 2 - Integer Input Validation (Partial)
def get_integer_input():
    while True:
        try:
            user_input = input("Enter an integer: ")
            # Your code to convert to integer and handle ValueError goes here
            # ...
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter an integer.")


# Exercise 3 - Custom Exception (Partial)
class InvalidEmailError(Exception):
    pass

def validate_email(email):
    # Your code to check for "@" and raise InvalidEmailError goes here
    # ...
```


This lesson provides a foundation for understanding and implementing exception handling in Python.  Practicing with the exercises and exploring different exception types will further solidify your understanding. Remember to consult Python's documentation for a comprehensive list of built-in exceptions.
